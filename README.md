### Name: TESS: The Extraordinary Sudoku Solver ###
### Version: 1.1 | 4/22/17 ###
### System Requirements: Galaxy Note 5, Android Studio, Any Android Phone(may have compatibility issues) ### 
### Description:
This is a fun and entertaining Sudoku game with an option to solve the current or any input puzzle. The current specifications were built to suite a Galaxy Note 5; however, hopefully in the future, it will be compatible with different models as well and eventually moved to IOS systems as well. There are a few options that make it different from most other Sudoku games currently on the market. First, the theme is a neon green with a black background, perfect for people who are tired of white screens everywhere. Second, there are a variety of difficulty settings for the user to choose from. Currently there are 5 difficulty settings, but there might be more in the future. Third, there is a solver component to the game as well. A user may input a puzzle for the system to solve or the user may choose one of the puzzles currently on the system and TESS will fill in the blanks. If the puzzle is invalid or can't be solved, a message saying the puzzle is invalid will appear. Overall, this is a fun app to play; however, it is still in the early stages of development, so there might still be bugs. Will be updating this app as time goes on.
